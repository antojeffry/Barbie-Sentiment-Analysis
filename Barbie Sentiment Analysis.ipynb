Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure its a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasnt expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, theres actually some real depth that I wasnt expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.  Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.  Im pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, its very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.  Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.  Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.  8/10.'"

Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can not wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can not decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might have been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot.'"

It addresses delicate and fragile topics with precision. It was surprising and totally unexpected. Admittedly, the first half an hour is hard to get through, but you really get into it once you get the idea and youre totally consumed in it and already questioning yourself and the society before you realise. However, they could have concluded it better by finding a middle ground or presenting a solution to the problems addressed. Nevertheless, its overall impact makes it a must-see for everyone.'"
